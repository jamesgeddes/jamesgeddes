#hello, world!

Thanks for dropping by my GitHub profile.

I have a keen interest in Python and automation, as people should be able to do more interesting things than turning handles. The big project I'm part of at the moment is at [geekzonehq/web](https://github.com/GeekZoneHQ/web), where we are (in a nutshell) building a community management system.

Other stuff you see here are tools that I build because I got annoyed with having to do those tasks manually, Everything is licensed under GPLv3, so feel free to do with it as you wish. If you find something useful, please consider buying me a coffee, either via my [Amazon wishlist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/WS5TGJQ9K8BS?ref_=wl_share) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/jamesgeddes).
