# 👋 Hello, I am James

**Senior Software Engineer specialising in Kubernetes, AWS, and infrastructure automation.**

I build deterministic, reproducible, Everything-as-Code platforms that remove operational burden and make teams faster, safer, and more scalable.

I am especially motivated by:
- Automation-first engineering
- Declarative platforms
- Reliability, correctness, and long-term maintainability
- Open source
- Helping teams level up through structure, clarity, and coaching

All my public work is fully libre and open source.

## Featured Projects
### Evoteum Kubernetes Lab

[evoteum/kubernetes-lab](https://github.com/evoteum/kubernetes-lab)

Kubernetes | Ansible | ArgoCD | HAProxy | Cilium

A fully automated multi-architecture bare-metal Kubernetes platform.

Highlights:
- HA control plane bootstrap with automated join and upgrades.
- GitOps for full cluster lifecycle.
- Deterministic configuration, zero manual operations.

### Drydock (in development)

[evoteum/drydock](https://github.com/evoteum/drydock)

Go | Tinkerbell | Kubernetes-native provisioning

A Kubernetes-native bare-metal provisioning pipeline that converts unprovisioned servers into HA clusters using PXE and immutable images.


### GitHub Estate Manager

[evoteum/estate-repos](https://github.com/evoteum/estate-repos)

Terraform | GitHub Actions

Declarative automation for managing entire GitHub organisations from a single YAML file.
- Creates repos, secrets, workflows, permissions, and registries.
- Enforces consistency and eliminates drift across an organisation.

### Planzoco

[evoteum/planzoco](https://github.com/evoteum/planzoco)

Go | Terraform | AWS ECS | GitHub Actions | Everything-as-Code

A collaborative event-planning platform built with a clean, deterministic Go backend and deployed through a fully automated IaC pipeline.

Highlights:
- Backend service for multi-dimensional voting workflows.
- Zero-manual ECS deployment pattern using Terraform modules.
- Automated CI/CD, secure defaults, and reproducible environments.
- Part of a wider Evoteum estate using organisation-wide IaC and GitOps.

### It’s Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas

[jamesgeddes/itsbeginningtolookalotlikechristmas](https://github.com/jamesgeddes/itsbeginningtolookalotlikechristmas)

Python | Terraform

An automated data-pipeline measuring the "Christmasyness" of the internet over time.
Runs unattended for years thanks to deterministic IaC and fully scripted orchestration.

### EFPB.org

[EppingForestPipeBand/EppingForestPipeBand.github.io](https://github.com/EppingForestPipeBand/EppingForestPipeBand.github.io)

Jekyll | GitHub Pages | Terraform

A photography and media gallery for The Epping Forest Pipe Band.
Simple, reliable, and maintained via GitHub Pages for low operational overhead.

### Geek.Zone Web

Community engagement platform

[GeekZoneHQ/web](https://github.com/GeekZoneHQ/web)

A web system for managing community events, membership, and engagement for the Geek.Zone charity.


## What I do (in practical terms)
- Design high-availability Kubernetes and AWS architectures
- Build end-to-end IaC pipelines using Terraform, OpenTofu, GitHub Actions, and GitLab
- Create repeatable deployment platforms (golden paths) for engineering teams
- Implement automation-first infrastructure engineering
- Champion upstream-aligned, low-friction, deterministic systems
- Coach and mentor engineers in DevOps, Kubernetes, and cloud architecture

If you would like to collaborate, hire me, or chat about infrastructure automation, feel free to shout.
